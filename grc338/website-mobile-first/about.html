            <h2> About us </h2>
				
            <p>    We are Isaac & Ember Mariposa, owners of Roasterz. We spent over 12 years dreaming, planning, learning and working in all things coffee with the hope that someday we would start a shop of our own.

                In September of 2016, we launched Roasterz on Garden Street in Downtown San Luis Obispo. Thank you so much to all of you who have made this possible.
                
                Our goal has always been to create inspiring spaces, with great people and amazing products, in a way that truly adds value to the community around us.
                
                We hope you love it here. </p>
